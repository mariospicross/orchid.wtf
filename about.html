    <p style="padding-top:10px;">hi! i'm orchid (she/her). along with everyone else who is as much as a loser as i am, i struggle to write about myself and my interests. but i'll try my best. i like to create things, and this site is a hub for all of that. i've dabbled in music, videography, photography, writing, art...pretty much any creative outlet you can think of. i'm also a digital archivist, RPG enthusiast, and wannabe developer.</p>
    <p>if you're interested in music commissions, please reach out to me at one of the contact locations listed below. we can discuss prices there. thank you.</p>
    <p>this site is still a huge work in progress, but i'm slowly chipping away at it! and if you're on mobile, please switch to desktop if possible! this site wasn't designed with mobile in mind.</p>

    <p>my "main" conventional messenger. if you don't have an account, it's completely free, and is a much better alternative to Discord.</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://discord.gg">discord</a> ~ 10kmotorola</p>
    <p>not my preferred platform, but i'm more active here due to its larger userbase.</p><br>
     <p><a href="https://orchidcnr.bandcamp.com">bandcamp</a> ~ orchidcnr</p>

    <p>i haven't updated this page in a long time, so this acts as an outdated alternative to bandcamp currently. go here if you'd like to download/purchase my music but you dislike bandcamp.</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/orchid.wtf">bluesky</a> ~ orchid.wtf</p>
    <p>the only social media i'm somewhat active on. even then, i don't post much. i really try to stay away from social media these days.</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/OrchidCNR">steam</a> ~ orchid</p>
    <p>i play games here! if you ever wanna play a PC game with me for some reason, here's where i am. i also finally got a steam deck recently so i've been a lot more active.</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/mariospicross">github</a> ~ mariospicross</p>
    <p>where i code and do other funny little shenanigans. you can also find my slightly outdated dotfiles here!</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/orchidcnr">retroachievements</a> ~ orchidcnr</p>
    <p>one of my favorite online communities. retroachievements is a brilliant site that adds community made achievements to retro games via emulation. i mostly develop achievements and participate in community events.</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/conair">retroachievements (alt)</a> ~ conair</p>
    <p>my mostly unused retroachievements alt account.</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://backloggd.com/u/orchidcnr">backloggd</a> ~ orchidcnr</p>
    <p>reviews and ratings of video games! i'm quite active on here. don't take my ratings too seriously; i mainly use this site to log games anyway.</p><br>
    <p><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~ConairWasTaken">rateyourmusic</a> ~ ConairWasTaken</p>
    <p>yup, i'm a loser. i'm not as active here as i used to be, but i always rate and log new releases when i listen to them here. you can also see a lot of my past ratings that i keep up to date with my current opinions. also one of the last places where i still go by my old username as changing usernames on rym requires premium. (i had the "WasTaken" moniker before Dream was around, i swear)</p><br>
